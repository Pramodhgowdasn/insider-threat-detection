🛡️ Insider Threat Detection System

An end-to-end Insider Threat Detection System designed to identify, analyze, and respond to malicious or risky activities performed by internal users within an organization.

This project focuses on behavioral analysis, risk scoring, and alert generation by correlating events across multiple internal data sources.

📌 Problem Statement

Insider threats are among the most difficult security challenges because they originate from authorized users. Traditional perimeter security systems often fail to detect:

* Privilege misuse
* Data exfiltration by employees
* Policy violations
* Anomalous behavior that appears legitimate

This system aims to detect such threats early using behavior baselining, rule-based logic, and machine learning.

🎯 Project Objectives

* Collect and normalize internal activity events
* Build behavioral baselines for users
* Detect anomalies and policy violations
* Assign risk scores to users and events
* Generate actionable alerts and cases
* Provide a centralized dashboard for analysts
